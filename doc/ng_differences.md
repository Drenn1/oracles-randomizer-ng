# Oracles-Randomizer-NG differences

Oracles-Randomizer-NG does some things differently from jangler's [original
randomizer](https://github.com/jangler/oracles-randomizer), and the feature set
is also a bit different.

## General changes

### Both games

- Treewarp is replaced with a "Warp To Start" option in the randomizer menu
  (accessible by pressing select twice in quick succession). It cannot be
  disabled.
- The Advance Shop is always open. Contents are not currently randomized,
  though.

### Seasons

- Treasure Map: Now works in Subrosia too. If a jewel is in Subrosia, you won't
  see it sparkling on the map if you're in the overworld; you must be in
  Subrosia.

### Ages

- D2 Present Entrance: When dungeon entrances are randomized, the two D2
  entrances are randomized independently of each other. This means that there
  will be some dungeon with two entrances, but it may not be Wing Dungeon.
- Ambi exchange: In jangler's randomizer, the red soldier who escorts you to
  ambi's palace was turned into an ordinary NPC and placed on a different
  screen. In NG, the soldier has still been turned into an NPC who you need to
  talk to, but he is placed on the screen where you would normally encounter him
  in the vanilla game.
- Goron Dance: It is now always possible to get the "brother emblem" check from
  either the past or the present. In jangler's randomizer, it was possible to
  get it in the past, but only if you didn't have the goron letter. The check
  name has accordingly been changed from "goron dance present" to "first goron
  dance".
- King Zora: In jangler's randomizer, if you'd already cured the seas when
  talking to King Zora in the present for the first time, you would need to exit
  and re-enter the room to talk to him again and get permission to open
  Jabu-Jabu. In NG, there is no need to re-enter the room, but you still need to
  talk to him twice (once for the item, once to open Jabu-Jabu).

## New features in NG

- Cross-Items: Get Ages items in Seasons, and vice-versa.
- Keysanity: Dungeon keys, maps, compasses, and slates (in Ages) are scattered
  across the overworld. Compasses work anywhere, but they chime a different tune
  depending on which dungeon the key is for.
- Dungeon item display: In the randomizer menu (accessible by pressing select
  twice in quick succession), you can access the "Dungeon Items" menu which
  shows you which items you've obtained in each dungeon. Useful for keeping
  track of progress in Keysanity mode.
- Music randomization: Randomize music tracks from both games, optionally
  including custom music tracks written by ZerotoKoops.

## Missing features in NG

- Multiworld
- Plando
- Linked games are disabled
