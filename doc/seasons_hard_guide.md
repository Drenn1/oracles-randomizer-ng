# Seasons Hard Logic Strategy Guide

This document details tricks and obscurities that are in Seasons hard logic.
See [seasons_notes.md](seasons_notes.md) for a list of things that are out of
logic even in hard.

## General

- Use mystery seeds to light torches (1 in 4 chance of success). This is only
  in logic for rooms with no more than 2 torches.
- Get various types of seeds from sources other than trees:
	- Pegasus seeds from Subrosia Market (requires shield)
	- Ember seeds from the plants in Agunima's room in D4
	- Ember seeds from the Armos puzzle chest in D5
	- Ember seeds from the plants in the first Poe Sister's room in D7
	- Mystery seeds from Frypolar's room in D8
- Get bombs from the plants in D2.
- Use bomb boosts to increase jump distance. Pull a bomb near the gap you're
  jumping, move slightly closer to the gap, and jump in the desired direction
  as the bomb explodes. Buffering the simultaneous jump + directional input by
  holding the relevant buttons while closing a menu makes the trick easier.

  Strictly horizontal and vertical bomb jumps include:
	- Lava between Mt. Cucco portal and Subrosia Market
	- Water between D5 entrance and minecart room
	- Lava before cave entrance in Temple Remains
	- Water in Sunken City diving cave
	- Water in cave under Floodgate Keeper's House
	- Lava in Goron Mountain cave
	- Water in Goron Mountain cave
	- Lava between north & south Subrosia
	- Lava in Subrosia on Temple Remains portal screen

  Specific multi-directional bomb jumps are detailed later in this document,
  with video examples.

### Cross-game items: general uses

- Cane of Somaria can be used to push hardhat beetles into holes (ie.
  map chest room in D2).
- Cane of Somaria can be used to kill water tektites by creating the
  block by the edge of the water, then pushing it into the water (ie. in D4).

## Overworld

- RNG manip 100-rupee drops using the shovel, for infinite rupees in logic.
  Hard reset, mash through the title screen (it rolls RNG every frame), make 7
  screen transitions, and dig until the 100-rupee drop. Make sure not to delay
  the dig after the Rope, since the Rope also rolls RNG periodically.

- Cucco clip: reach the cave below the Spring Banana tree by grabbing the Cucco
  through the corner â€“ move straight right into the rock before the screen
  transition so that the rock pushes you downward. This only matters if you
  have gale seeds to warp out.

- Cornerwalk across the gaps in the house on the Western Coast in order to

  hold right. To get back, reenter and walk straight up.

  without the feather. It is quite precise when using switch hook + pegasus
  seeds. (TODO: video)

  1F minecarts.

  video)

  obviating feather or a means to break the crystal.

## Not in logic but still cool

- D6: Seed Shooter can be used to hit the orbs on the path to Vire, without the
  magic boomerang. This requires using pegasus seeds to wall-clip into
  a specific pixel, and furthermore, may be subpixel dependent. (TODO: video)
